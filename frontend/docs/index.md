# Intro

Shields.io is a service for concise, consistent, and legible badges, which can easily be included in GitHub readmes or any other web page. The service supports dozens of continuous integration services, package registries, distributions, app stores, social networks, code coverage services, and code analysis services. It is used by some of the world's most popular open-source projects.

Browse a [complete list of badges](/badges) and locate a particular badge by using the search bar or by browsing the categories.

Use the builder to fill in required path parameters for that badge type (like your username or repo) and optionally customize (label, colors etc.). And it's ready for use! Copy your badge url or code snippet, which can then be added to places like your GitHub readme files or other web pages.
