# Static Badges

It is possible to use shields.io to make a wide variety of badges displaying static text and/or logos. For example:

- ![any text you like](https://img.shields.io/badge/any%20text-you%20like-blue) - https://img.shields.io/badge/any%20text-you%20like-blue
- ![just the message](https://img.shields.io/badge/just%20the%20message-8A2BE2) - https://img.shields.io/badge/just%20the%20message-8A2BE2
- !['for the badge' style](https://img.shields.io/badge/%27for%20the%20badge%27%20style-20B2AA?style=for-the-badge) - https://img.shields.io/badge/%27for%20the%20badge%27%20style-20B2AA?style=for-the-badge
- ![with a logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/with%20a%20logo-grey?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript) - https://img.shields.io/badge/with%20a%20logo-grey?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript
