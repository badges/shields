Since the [project's inception](https://github.com/badges/shields/commit/3f3f1b30bb8aade8ab6907fab3b7f889dfb3e882#diff-37854d19817c792316d481f5beb93cc7), Shields.io has been licensed under the CC0 public domain license.

Today, we’re adopting a dual-license model, re-licensing the project under both the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses. This change means that new revisions of Shields will now be considered copyrighted work that builds upon and modifies the public domain code from earlier versions.

Shields has always embraced the public domain through the openness of its CC0 license, a spirit that has defined the project over the years. This licensing change isn’t about moving away from that ethos, but rather about strengthening the foundation for maintainers and contributors. The MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses provide clear warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability, offering a more reliable and legally safe framework for ongoing development.
