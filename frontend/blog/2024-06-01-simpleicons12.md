Logos on Shields.io are provided by SimpleIcons. We've recently upgraded to SimpleIcons 12. This release removes the following 10 icons:

- FITE
- Flattr
- Google Bard
- Integromat
- Niantic
- Nintendo Network
- Rome
- Shotcut
- Skynet
- Twitter

And renames the following 3:

- Airbrake.io to Airbrake
- Amazon AWS to Amazon Web Services
- RStudio to RStudio IDE

More details can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/releases/tag/12.0.0).

Please remember that we are just consumers of SimpleIcons. Decisions about changes and removals are made by the [SimpleIcons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) project.
