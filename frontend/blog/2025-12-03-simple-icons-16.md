Logos on Shields.io are provided by Simple Icons. We've recently upgraded to Simple Icons 16. This release removes 44 icons and renames 2. A full list of the changes can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/releases/tag/16.0.0).

Please remember that we are just consumers of Simple Icons. Decisions about changes and removals are made by the [SimpleIcons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) project.
