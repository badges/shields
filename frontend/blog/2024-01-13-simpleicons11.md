Logos on Shields.io are provided by SimpleIcons. We've recently upgraded to SimpleIcons 11. This release removes the following 4 icons:

- Babylon.js
- Hulu
- Pepsi
- Uno

More details can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/releases/tag/11.0.0).

Please remember that we are just consumers of SimpleIcons. Decisions about changes and removals are made by the [SimpleIcons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) project.
