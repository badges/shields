# Contribution Guidelines

This is the home of Shields.io, home to the badge design specification, API documentation, and server code for Badges as a Service.

We invite participation through [GitHub Issues][], which we use much like a discussion forum. This repository should only contain non-implementation specific topics: specifications, design, and the web site.

## This implementation

Please see [INSTALL.md][] for information on how to start contributing code to
shields.io.

[INSTALL.md]: ./INSTALL.md

Note that the root gets redirected to <http://shields.io>.
For testing purposes, you can go to `http://localhost/try.html`.
You should modify that file. The "real" root, `http://localhost/index.html`,
gets generated from the `try.html` file.

## Ground rules

- The left-hand side of a badge should not advertize. It should be a noun
  describing succinctly the meaning of the right-hand-side data.
- New query parameters (such as `?label=` or `?style=`) should apply to any
  requested badge. They must be registered in the cache (see `LruCache` in
  `server.js`).

## Implementations

The main implementation, available at <http://shields.io>, has its code located in this repository.

Other systems that produce badges following the same design, hosted elsewhere, are listed below.

Please report **bugs** and discuss implementation specific concerns (performance characteristics, etc.) in the repository for the respective implementation.

## Adding support for a service

Please [open an issue][new issue] if you'd like to use Shields badges for a project that isn't yet supported.
