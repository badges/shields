# Hosting your own Shields server

## Installation

You will need Node 8 or later, which you can install using a
[package manager][].

On Ubuntu / Debian:

```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -; sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/badges/shields.git
cd shields
npm ci  # You may need sudo for this.
```

[package manager]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

## Build the frontend

```sh
npm run build
```

## Start the server

```sh
sudo node server
```

The server uses port 80 by default, which requires `sudo` permissions.

There are two ways to provide an alternate port:

```sh
PORT=8080 node server
node server 8080
```

The root gets redirected to https://shields.io.

For testing purposes, you can go to `http://localhost/`.

## Heroku

Once you have installed the [Heroku Toolbelt][]:

```bash
heroku login
heroku create your-app-name
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/mojodna/heroku-buildpack-multi.git#build-env
make deploy
heroku open
```

## Docker

You can build and run the server locally using Docker. First build an image:

```console
$ docker build -t shields .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 3.923 MB
…
Successfully built 4471b442c220
```

Optionally, create a file called `shields.env` that contains the needed
configuration. See [server-secrets.md](server-secrets.md) and [../config/custom-environment-variables.yml](config/custom-environment-variables.yml) for examples.

Then run the container:

```console
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 --name shields shields
# or if you have shields.env file, run the following instead
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 --env-file shields.env --name shields shields

> gh-badges@1.1.2 start /usr/src/app
> node server.js

http://[::1]/
```

Assuming Docker is running locally, you should be able to get to the
application at http://localhost:8080/.

If you run Docker in a virtual machine (such as boot2docker or Docker Machine)
then you will need to replace `localhost` with the IP address of that virtual
machine.

## Zeit Now

To deploy using Zeit Now:

```console
npm run build  # Not sure why, but this needs to be run before deploying.
now
```

## Persistence

To enable Redis-backed GitHub token persistence, point `REDIS_URL` to your
Redis installation.

## Server secrets

You can add your own server secrets in environment variables or `config/local.yml`.

These are documented in [server-secrets.md](./server-secrets.md)

## Separate frontend hosting

If you want to host the frontend on a separate server, such as cloud storage
or a CDN, you can do that.

First, build the frontend, pointing `GATSBY_BASE_URL` to your server.

```sh
GATSBY_BASE_URL=https://your-server.example.com npm run build
```

Then copy the contents of the `build/` folder to your static hosting / CDN.

There are also a couple settings you should configure on the server.

If you want to use server suggestions, you should also set `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`:

```sh
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://my-custom-shields.s3.amazonaws.com,https://my-custom-shields.s3.amazonaws.com
```

This should be a comma-separated list of allowed origin headers. They should
not have paths or trailing slashes.

To help out users, you can make the Shields server redirect the server root.
Set the `REDIRECT_URI` environment variable:

```sh
REDIRECT_URI=http://my-custom-shields.s3.amazonaws.com/
```

## Sentry

In order to enable integration with [Sentry](https://sentry.io), you need your own [Sentry DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/quickstart/#configure-the-dsn). It’s an URL in format `https://{PUBLIC_KEY}:{SECRET_KEY}@sentry.io/{PROJECT_ID}`.

### How to obtain the Sentry DSN

1.  [Sign up](https://sentry.io/pricing/) for Sentry
2.  Log in to Sentry
3.  Create a new project for Node.js
4.  You should see [Sentry DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/quickstart/#configure-the-dsn) for your project. Sentry DSN can be found by navigating to \[Project Name] -> Project Settings -> Client Keys (DSN) as well.

Start the server using the Sentry DSN. You can set it:

- by `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable

```
sudo SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx:yyy@sentry.io/zzz node server
```

- or by `sentry_dsn` secret property defined in `private/secret.json`

```
sudo node server
```

### Prometheus

Shields uses [prom-client](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client) to provide [default metrics](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_clientlibs/#standard-and-runtime-collectors). These metrics are disabled by default.
You can enable them by `METRICS_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED` environment variable. Moreover access to metrics resource is blocked for requests from any IP address by default. You can provide a regular expression with allowed IP addresses by `METRICS_PROMETHEUS_ALLOWED_IPS` environment variable.

```bash
METRICS_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true METRICS_PROMETHEUS_ALLOWED_IPS="^127\.0\.0\.1$" npm start
```

Metrics are available at `/metrics` resource.
