## Attached state

Shields has mercifully little persistent state:

1. The GitHub tokens we collect are stored in a fly.io postgres database
2. The server keeps the [resource cache][] in memory. It is neither
   persisted nor inspectable.

[resource cache]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/core/base-service/resource-cache.js

## Configuration

To bootstrap the configuration of non-secret settings, we set a single environment variable:

```
NODE_CONFIG_ENV=shields-io-production
```

With that variable set, the server ([using `config`][config]) reads these
files:

- [`local-shields-io-production.yml`][local-shields-io-production.yml].
  This file contains secrets which are checked in with a deploy commit.
- [`shields-io-production.yml`][shields-io-production.yml]. This file
  contains non-secrets which are checked in to the main repo.
- [`default.yml`][default.yml]. This file contains defaults.

Secrets are supplied directly as environment vars.

[config]: https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files
[local-shields-io-production.yml]: ../config/local-shields-io-production.template.yml
[shields-io-production.yml]: ../config/shields-io-production.yml
[default.yml]: ../config/default.yml

## Badge CDN

Sitting in front of the three servers is a Cloudflare Free account which
provides several services:

- Global CDN, caching, and SSL gateway for `img.shields.io` and `shields.io`
- Analytics through the Cloudflare dashboard
- DNS resolution for `shields.io` (and subdomains)

Cloudflare is configured to respect the servers' cache headers.

## Raster server

The raster server `raster.shields.io` (a.k.a. the rasterizing proxy) is
hosted on Heroku. It's managed in the
[squint](https://github.com/badges/squint/) repo.

### Fly.io Deployment

Both the badge server and frontend are served from Fly.io. Deployments are
triggered using GitHub actions in a private repo.

## DNS

DNS is registered with [DNSimple][].

[dnsimple]: https://dnsimple.com/

## Error reporting

[Error reporting][sentry] is one of the most useful tools we have for monitoring
the server. It's generously donated by [Sentry][sentry home]. We bundle
[`@sentry/node`][sentry-node] into the application, and the Sentry DSN is configured
via `local-shields-io-production.yml` (see [documentation][sentry configuration]).

[sentry]: https://sentry.io/shields/
[sentry-node]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/node
[sentry home]: https://sentry.io/shields/
[sentry configuration]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md#sentry

## URLs

The canonical and only recommended domain for badge URLs is `img.shields.io`. Currently it is possible to request badges on both `img.shields.io` and `shields.io` i.e: https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen and https://shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen will both work. However:

- We never show or generate the `img.`-less URL format on https://shields.io/
- We make no guarantees about the `img.`-less URL format. At some future point we may remove the ability to serve badges on `shields.io` (without `img.`) without any warning. `img.shields.io` should always be used for badge urls.

## Monitoring

Overall server performance and requests by service are monitored using
[Prometheus and Grafana][metrics].

Request performance is monitored in two places:

- [Status][] (using [UptimeRobot][])
- [Server metrics][] using Prometheus and Grafana
- [@RedSparr0w's monitor][monitor] which posts [notifications][] to a private
  [#monitor chat room][monitor discord]
