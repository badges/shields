This is home to [Shields.io][shields.io], a service for concise, consistent,
and legible badges in SVG and raster format, which can easily be included in
GitHub readmes or any other web page. The service supports dozens of
continuous integration services, package registries, distributions, app
stores, social networks, code coverage services, and code analysis services.
Every month it serves over 470 million images.

This repo hosts:

- The [Shields.io][shields.io] frontend and server code
- An [NPM library for generating badges][badge-maker]
  - [documentation][badge-maker-docs]
  - [changelog][badge-maker-changelog]
- The [badge design specification][badge-spec]

[Make your own badges!][custom badges]
(Quick example: `https://img.shields.io/badge/left-right-f39f37`)

[custom badges]: http://shields.io/#your-badge

### Quickstart

Browse a [complete list of badges][shields.io] and locate a particular badge by using the search bar or by browsing the categories. Click on the badge to fill in required data elements for that badge type (like your username or repo) and optionally customize (label, colors etc.). And it's ready for use!

Use the button at the bottom to copy your badge url or snippet, which can then be added to places like your GitHub readme files or other web pages.

## Contributing

Shields is a community project. We invite your participation through issues
and pull requests! You can peruse the [contributing guidelines][contributing].

When adding or changing a service [please add tests][service-tests].

This project has quite a backlog of suggestions! If you're new to the project,
maybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of them:

[![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/badges/shields/good%20first%20issue)](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

You can read a [tutorial on how to add a badge][tutorial].

## Development

1. Install Node 10 or later. You can use the [package manager][] of your choice.
   Tests need to pass in Node 10 and 12.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the badge server and the frontend dev server.
5. Open `http://localhost:3000/` to view the frontend.

When server source files change, the badge server should automatically restart
itself (using [nodemon][]). When the frontend files change, the frontend dev
server (`gatsby dev`) should also automatically reload. However the badge
definitions are built only before the server first starts. To regenerate those,
either run `npm run defs` or manually restart the server.

To debug a badge from the command line, run `npm run badge -- /npm/v/nock`.
It also works with full URLs like
`npm run badge -- https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nock`.

Use `npm run debug:server` to start server in debug mode.
[This recipe][nodemon debug] shows how to debug Node.js application in [VS Code][].

Shields has experimental support for [Gitpod][gitpod], a pre-configured development
environment that runs in your browser. To use Gitpod, click the button below and
sign in with GitHub. Gitpod also offers a browser add-on, though it is not required.
Please report any Gitpod bugs, questions, or suggestions in issue
[#2772](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/2772).

[![Edit with Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/badges/shields)

[Snapshot tests][] ensure we don't inadvertently make changes that affect the
SVG or JSON output. When deliberately changing the output, run
`SNAPSHOT_DRY=1 npm run test:js:server` to preview changes to the saved
snapshots, and `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 npm run test:js:server` to update them.

The server can be configured to use [Sentry][] ([configuration][sentry configuration]) and [Prometheus][] ([configuration][prometheus configuration]).

Daily tests, including a full run of the service tests and overall code coverage, are run via [badges/daily-tests][daily-tests].

## History

b.adge.me was the original website for this service. Heroku back then had a
thing which made it hard to use a toplevel domain with it, hence the odd
domain. It used code developed in 2013 from a library called
[gh-badges][old-gh-badges], both developed by [Thaddée Tyl][espadrine].
The project merged with shields.io by making it use the b.adge.me code
and closed b.adge.me.

The original badge specification was developed in 2013 by
[Olivier Lacan][olivierlacan]. It was inspired by the Travis CI and similar
badges (there were a lot fewer, back then). In 2014 Thaddée Tyl redesigned
it with help from a Travis CI employee and convinced everyone to switch to
it. The old design is what today is called the plastic style; the new one
is the flat style.

You can read more about [the project's inception][thread],
[the motivation of the SVG badge specification][motivation], and
