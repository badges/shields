# Shields [![Gittip](http://img.shields.io/gittip/shields.io.png)](https://www.gittip.com/Shields.io/)

A legible & concise status badge solution for third-party codebase services.
Soon to be Retina-ready.

## Problem

An increasing number of GitHub repos sport badges for things like:

- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) build status: 

![travis badge](http://f.cl.ly/items/2H233M0I0T43313c3h0C/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-30%20at%202.45.30%20AM.png)

- [Gemnasium](https://gemnasium.com/) dependency checks:

- [Code Climate](http://codeclimate.com):

- [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org) released gem version: 

![rubygems badge](http://f.cl.ly/items/443X21151h1V301s2s3a/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-30%20at%202.47.10%20AM.png)

As you can see from the zoomed 400% versions of these badges above, nobody is
(really) using the same badge file and at normal size, they're hardly legible.
Worst of all, they're completely inconsistent. The information provided isn't
of the same kind on each badge. The context is blurry, which doesn't make for Ã¥
straightforward understanding of how these badges are relevant to the project
they're attached to and what information they provide. 


## Solution

As you can see below, without increasing the footprint of these badges, I've
tried to increase legibility and coherence, removing useless text to decrease
the horizontal length in the (likely) scenario that more of these badge
thingies crop up on READMEs all across the land.

Thanks to @ackerdev we also have SVG equivalents of all existing badges if you
would like your badges to be Retina-ready or dynamically manipulate the text
inside of them before you output them to PNG 24 Alpha (transparent background).


## Specification

### Guidelines

- **legible**: it should be as easy to read the metadata provided by a badge as
  it is to read body copy inside of a README file regardless of display
resolution
- **semantic**: the purpose information provided by a badge should be
  self-evident
- **non-promotional**: badges should not advertise but instead provide value
  through information
- **concise**: one descriptive word on the left (the key), one piece of data on
  the right (the value)
- **hyperlinked**: badges can link to a third-party website providing more
  information, either related to the metadata provided by the badge or about
the project the badge was used for (e.g. an open source library) 


### Aesthetics

The design of Shields badges has been carefully considered to provide
sufficient padding between the container badge and the text within. Badges
should never have a fixed width. The letter spacing (or kerning) is deliberate
and focused on clarity, so is the use of the Open Sans font face. Contrary to
widely available web-safe alternative sans-serif fonts like Arial (a sloppy
Helvetica ripoff) and Verdana (a sloppy Futura ripoff), OpenSans remains highly
legible at very small sizes which is why it was chosen.

![](https://raw.github.com/badges/shields/master/static/proportions.png)

You can find a copy (including its Apache license) of Open Sans in the `font/`
directory of this repository.

When it comes to color choices, the focus is on clear contrast between the text
and the background color on both sides of the badge (key and value). The two
sides are also contrasted with each other with the key side always retaining a
dark grey color for consistency, and the value side taking on whichever
background color better conveys the meaning of the data provided (e.g. green
for a successful build, red for a failed build).


## Examples

What kind of meta data can you convey using Shields badges?

- test build status: `build | failing`
- code coverage percentage: `coverage | 80%`
- stable release version: `version | 1.2.3`
- package manager release: `gem | 1.2.3`
- status of third-party dependencies: `dependencies | out-of-date`
- static code analysis GPA: `code climate | 3.8`
- [semver](http://semver.org/) version observance: `semver | 2.0.0`
- amount of [gittip](http://gittip.com) donations per week: `tips | $2/week`


## Retina Ready

Since one of the major concerns is legibility, it's impossible to ignore how
bad shields will look on retina (high DPI) displays.

A suggested by @kneath, Shields displayed with an HTML image tag (instead of
the easier Markdown image tag) can be given a fixed height to force an image
that is actually double the resolution into a 50% smaller image, which will
display properly for both retina and non-retina screens.

Here's an example with the following code: 

```html
<img src="https://raw.github.com/badges/shields/master/static/shields_white@2x.png" 
     height="143" alt="Retina-ready Shields example" />
```

<img
src="https://raw.github.com/badges/shields/master/static/shields_white@2x.png"
height="143" alt="Retina-ready Shields example" />

All shields aren't yet compatible with this but we're working on updating them
soon. Look for image filenames with `@2x` suffixes, those will be the pixel
doubled versions. 

Note: They were pixel doubled manually in Photoshop, not after the fact.


## Font

The font used on these badges is the Apache licensed Open Sans Regular
available from [Google Web
Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans).


## How to resize a Shield

Want to use one of these swanky badges for your own service right now and don't
have time to [open an issue](https://github.com/gittip/shields.io/issues) and
wait for us to help you out?

Well here's a hint, if you need to resize the badge yourself in Photoshop make
sure you use the vector points [like this](http://link.olivierlacan.com/MmlK).

In Illustrator, it's [a little
different](http://f.cl.ly/items/071J0Q2m0D38250g2s1F/shields_resize_illustrator.mov)
(4.8 MB .mov video).
