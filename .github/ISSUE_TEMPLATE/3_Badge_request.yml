        ## Ideas for new badges


        This issue template is for suggesting new badges which
        **fetch and display data from an upstream service**.
        If your suggestion is for a static badge
        (which shows the same information every time it is requested), it is
        [already possible to make these](https://shields.io/docs/static-badges).
        We don't add specific routes for badges which only show static information.

        A clear and concise description of the new badge.

        - Which service is this badge for e.g: GitHub, Travis CI
        - What sort of information should this badge show?
          Provide an example in plain text e.g: "version | v1.01" or as a static badge
          (static badge generator can be found at https://shields.io/badges/static-badge )

        Where can we get the data from?

        Please consider and cover details like:
        - Is there a public API?
        - Does the API require authentication or an API key?
          If so, please review our documentation on [Badges Requiring Authentication](https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/authentication.md)
        - Link to the API documentation.
