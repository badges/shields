** Removal:** For users who need to maintain a Github Token pool, storage has been provided via the `RedisTokenPersistence` and `REDIS_URL` settings. This feature was deprecated in `server-2023-03-01`. As of this release, the `RedisTokenPersistence` backend is now removed. If you are using this feature, you will need to migrate to using the `SQLTokenPersistence` backend for storage and provide a postgres connection string via the `POSTGRES_URL` setting.

## server-2023-01-01

- Breaking change: Routes for GitHub workflows badge have changed. See https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/8671 for more details
- Behaviour change: In this release we fixed a long standing bug. GitHub badges were previously not reading the base URL from the `config.service.baseUri`.
  This release fixes that bug, bringing the code into line with the documented behaviour. This should not cause a behaviour change for most users,
  but users who had previously set a value in `config.service.baseUri` which was previously ignored could see this now have an effect.
  Users who configure their instance using env vars rather than yaml should see no change.
