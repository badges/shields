# Security Policy

## Supported Projects

We will provide fixes for security issues affecting:

- [Shields.io](https://shields.io)
- Users running their own self-hosted Shields instance
- The [badge-maker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/badge-maker) NPM package

The [gh-badges](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-badges) NPM package is now deprecated and will no longer receive fixes for bugs or security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability affecting any of our supported projects, please email [security@shields.io](mailto:security@shields.io), rather than opening a public issue on GitHub. After receiving the initial report, we will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement. We may ask you for additional information.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We aim to patch vulnerabilities within 90 days or less, disclosing the details of those vulnerabilities when a patch is published. We ask that you refrain from sharing your report with others while we work on our patch.

We may want to coordinate an advisory with you to be published simultaneously with the patch, but you are also welcome to self-disclose if you prefer. We will never publish information about you or our communications with you without your permission.
